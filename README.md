# Of anagrams, probability, entropy, and tyPhon ;)

Starting from Ex 43 in Prof. [Torbj√∂rn Lager](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/torbjornlager)'s "List of 46 Simple Python Exercises" (available for example [here](https://github.com/arsho/46-Simple-Python-Exercises-Solutions/blob/master/46%20Simple%20Python%20Exercises.pdf)), we indulge in some random combinatorial musings.

Best enjoyed as a Binder!

## Original text of the exercise

An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; e.g., orchestra ~ carthorse. Using the word list available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quinnj/Rosetta-Julia/master/unixdict.txt),  write a program that finds the sets of words that share the same characters that contain the most words in them.
